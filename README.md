# data_cleaning
This repository holds my project submission for the Coursera course on
getting and cleaning data by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

## run_analysis.R
This file contains the commented source code in the R programming language that cleans the raw data and tidies it up.
To use it, the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip has to reside in the
same directory as the script (and has to be unpacked). The result will be saved into result.txt.

## result.txt
This is the result as written by the run_analysis() function.

## codebook.md
This file contains a description of the data in result.txt.
