# result.txt
This file holds the data as tidied up and written out by the run_analysis function written in R.
The source for the original raw data processed by the function can be obtained from
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
General information on the recorded raw data can be found here:

## Contained data
The raw data was combined into one table and filtered to contain only mean and standard deviation data.
Then it was grouped by activity and recorded person (subject).
Each row in the result.txt file represents the mean of the raw data columns for a given activity and person.

## Fields
This section describes the fields contained in the result.txt file and their value ranges.

### activity
This field describes the activity the motion data was recorded for. It can hold one of the following values:
* LAYING (the person was laying)
* SITTING (the person was sitting)
* STANDING (the person was standing, but not moving)
* WALKING (the person was walking, but not changing elevation)
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (the person was walking downstairs)
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS (the person was walking upstairs)

### subject
The subject field holds an identifier for each recorded person.
30 persons were recorded overall.

### motion data
The remaining fields hold the motion data from cell phones the recorded persons had on their bodies.
The values range from -1.0 to 1.0.
Some sensors return separate values for the X, Y, and Z direction. Their names end in -X, -Y, and -Z respectively.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* angle(): Angle between to vectors.
